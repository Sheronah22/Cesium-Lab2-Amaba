                          <h1>The Sims 4</h1>
                          <p>This is a “sandbox” simulation game in which players create, customize, and control characters called “Sims” through their daily activities. 
                             The game features an open-ended gameplay, where players can choose their own goals and objectives, and customize their Sims' appearance, personality, skills, relationships, and environment.
